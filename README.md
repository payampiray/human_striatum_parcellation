Connectivity-based parcellation of the human striatum based on resting fMRI, including 5 clusters:  
ventral striatum (vS)  
medial caudate (mC)  
dorsal caudate (dC)  
anterior putaman (aP)  
posterior putaman (aP)  
  
Number of clusters has been chosen based on a stability of clusters in two independent samples. See the following reference for details.  
  
Please cite this paper if you use either of these clusters:
